# Reddit_Research

### basic_graphs is the first iteration of the work I started with a lot of simple plots for the entire dataset as well as code that looks at one subreddit.

### mod_churn is similar but looking across the entire dataset and makes many of the same calculations just with the entire sample not with one individual subreddit.

### mod_churn_per_subreddit calculates mod churn for each subreddit and then appends it to the whole mod dataset and is the most efficient method.  I also compared moderator data to subscriber data.
